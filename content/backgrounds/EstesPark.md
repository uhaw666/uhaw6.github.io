imageDescription: "On a clear night at Rocky Mountain National Park, my three friends and i were camping and the sky was clear as can be. I decided to have my shutter open or about 30 minutes and ended up with this picture! I never knew i would find the center “north” star so it was a lot of luck capturing a single star without a trail."
